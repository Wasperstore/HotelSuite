UI Flow:

Use wizard-style modal (multi-step form with "Next" & "Back" buttons)

Show progress bar at top (e.g., Step 1 of 8)

Save draft after each step to prevent data loss.

Backend Handling:

Create owner first (transaction)

Create hotel record with foreign key to owner

If template → import pre-configured data from hotel_templates table

Assign subscription

Set up subdomain or custom domain mapping

Scalability Notes:

Store templates in database for easy updates

Allow Super Admin to add/edit templates from dashboard
