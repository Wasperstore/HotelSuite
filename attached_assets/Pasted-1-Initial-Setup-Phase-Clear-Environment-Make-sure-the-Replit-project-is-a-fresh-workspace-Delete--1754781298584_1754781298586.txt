1️⃣ Initial Setup Phase
Clear Environment
Make sure the Replit project is a fresh workspace. Delete any placeholder or previous test files so Replit AI doesn’t mix in old code.

Initialize Git Repo
Enable version control in Replit so every AI-generated code chunk is committed — allowing you to roll back easily.

Setup Monorepo Structure

/frontend → Next.js or React + Vite

/backend → Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM

/shared → Common types, constants, utils

/infrastructure → Dockerfile, deployment configs

2️⃣ AI Build Sequence
(You can feed this to Replit AI in steps, instead of dumping the whole PRD at once.)

Database & Multi-Tenant Schema

Build PostgreSQL schema with Prisma for multi-tenancy (row-based tenant isolation).

Include seed scripts for Super Admin and one demo Hotel Owner.

Backend Core (Auth + RBAC)

JWT-based authentication.

Role-based access middleware.

Unique routing by role: /super-admin, /[hotelSlug]/manager, etc.

Frontend Core Setup

Global theme & styles (from PRD theme section).

Mobile-responsive layout with sidebar navigation (no tabs).

Dark/light mode toggle.

Domain Separation Logic

Super Admin → admin.luxuryhotelsaas.com

Diesel usage tracker.

3️⃣ Testing & Validation
Use seeded data to test role-based navigation.

Ensure no duplicate email creation system-wide.

Test login redirects for each role.

Simulate multiple hotels to confirm data isolation.

4️⃣ Deployment & Scaling
Configure for Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Supabase/Render (backend).

Setup CI/CD pipeline in Replit with GitHub Actions.

Add custom domain mappings for hotel portals.

5️⃣ Pricing Model Integration
Implement Stripe subscription billing (monthly/yearly).

Track feature usage per plan.
